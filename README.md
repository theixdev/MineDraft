# MineDraft

  HOW TO USE :  Paint the suggested task from the top corner of the screen, but watch out for mines!  Hitting a mine will end your paint session and you will have to reset.  The color of your pen will darken when you get close to a mine and remain normal when there are no mines near by.
Mines are randomly placed on each turn.
